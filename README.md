# Game of Life Simulation

This project is a terminal-based implementation of **Conway's Game of Life**, a zero-player game that simulates cellular automata. The simulation follows simple rules to model complex and evolving patterns, bringing Conway's fascinating creation to life directly in your terminal.

## About Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a mathematical model of computation devised by British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a grid-based simulation where cells transition between two states, **alive** or **dead**, based on the number of alive neighbors. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life is known for its ability to demonstrate incredibly complex behaviors and structures.
